# TinyFPGA_A2-7Segment

The files here are part of how I am trying to learn to program the TinyFPGA A2 board.

They are more of a record of what went on than a training aid for others but if they help..... great.

The files are created using Lattice Diamond and the open drawing should help with the wiring.

Of course there is a resistor between the output pin on the A2 and each LED Element and the value will be specific to your display. Mine was 220 ohms.
The common earth from your display will go to the -ve rail on your board.
